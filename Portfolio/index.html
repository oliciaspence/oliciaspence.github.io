    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there, my name is Olicia Spence and I was born and raised in beautiful Nashville, TN. I graduated from Beech Senior High School in 2014 and that is right around the time I met my then boyfriend and current husband Miguel. We have been together over 8 years and have been married for a little over 1 year. We share a beautiful husky mix puppy together, Jasper, who always demands to be the center of our attention.</p>

    <p>When I'm not coding or actively expanding my knowledge in the tech industry, I am more than likely showing homes to a friend or family. I have been a licensed Real Estate Agent since 2019 and am currently doing this part-time as people come to me with guidance in purchasing or selling a home. At one point in my life, I thought real estate would be the career I practiced until I was old and gray. However, the more I learned about the tech industry, the more it enticed me to come be a part of the community.</p>

    <p>I decided to make the switch to tech while sitting on the beach on vacation with my husband in 2022. We worked so hard to afford this vacation and finally had the time and money to kick back, relax, and reflect. Durring this refelection, I realized I would more than likely be much happier learning to code and working as a full-time Web Developer. This career would enable me to continuously grow and expand my knowledge by constantly keeping up with new languages, software, and processes. I always do my best work when my brain is stiimulated and challenged. Unfortunately, my current career just wasn't challenging enough. So I decided once we arrived back home, I would enroll in a front-end coding bootcamp and set a goal to learn as much as I could so that I could begin a successful career in tech.</p>

    <p>So far, I am enjoying the journey! I love feeling like I've learned so much but yet there is still so much more to learn and dive into. I feel inspired and motivated everyday to come sit at my computer and help to create beautiful, innovative projects. I don't see myself ever changing my line of work. I feel at home in tech.</p>

    <p>When I'm not coding or selling real estate, I really enjoy doing anything outside. I live a short 5 minute walk from a beautiful lake here in Nashville so you will almost always find me and Jasper there walking, kayaking, and exploring. I am a self-taught aritst as well so you will often catch me painting a beautiful piece to hang somewhere in my home or to gift to a friend.</p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio and learning a little about me! I would love to connect and hear what you think! If you would like to collaborate on a future project or just chat about all things web deveolpment, feel free to visit my Connect with Me page. Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
